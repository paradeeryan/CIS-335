FIRST NORMAL FORM (1NF):
-everything is broken down into smallest form

-* A table is referred to as being in its First Normal Form if atomicity of the table is 1.
	Here, atomicity states that a single cell cannot hold multiple values.
	It must hold only a single-valued attribute
	
DEF:
- Atomicity - means that multiple operations can be grouped into a single logical entity, that is,
 other threads of control accessing the database will either see all of the changes or none of the changes.

SECONT NORMAL FORM (2NF):
-needs to be in first normal form
-has to have primary key

-* Second Normal Form (2NF) is based on the concept of full functional dependency.
	Second Normal Form applies to relations with composite keys, that is, relations with a primary key composed of two or more attributes.
	A relation with a single-attribute primary key is automatically in at least 2N 
	
DEF:
- composite key -  in SQL can be defined as a combination of multiple columns,
	and these columns are used to identify all the rows that are involved uniquely.
	Even though a single column can't identify any row uniquely,
	a combination of over one column can uniquely identify any record.
	
- primary key -  is a single field or combination of fields that uniquely defines a record.
	None of the fields that are part of the primary key can contain a NULL value.
	A table can have only one primary key. You use either the CREATE TABLE statement
	or the ALTER TABLE statement to create a primary key in SQL.

THIRD NORMAL FORM (3NF):
-needs to follow second normal form
-every non prime field must be dependant on primary key
-edgar cod

-* A given relation is said to be in its third normal form when it's in 2NF but has no transitive partial dependency.
	Meaning, when no transitive dependency exists for the attributes that are non-prime, then the relation can be said to be in 3NF.
	
DEF:
- Transitive dependency - in a database is an indirect relationship between values in the same table that causes a functional dependency.
	By nature, a transitive dependency requires three or more attributes. To achieve the normalization standard of Third Normal Form (3NF),
	any transitive dependency must be eliminated
	
	
FINAL PROJECT:
*code(required)*
-needs 5 tables
-needs 2 triggers (stored procedure that happens when data changes)
-at least 2 views
-4 stored procedures (creating/inserting, updating, deleting records)

*design (not required)*
-5 primary tables & 5 supporting tables (relationship tables, lookup tables, etc..)

*misc*
-topic
-can be used in future class' projects
