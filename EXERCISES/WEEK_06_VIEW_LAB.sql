/*Problem 1
Create a view named open_items that shows the invoices that havenâ€™t been paid.
 This view should return four columns from the Vendors and
 Invoices tables: vendor_name, invoice_number, invoice_total, and balance_due (invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total).
A row should only be returned when the balance due is greater than zero, and the rows should be in sequence by vendor_name.

	with one row for each invoice that has a balance due of $1000 or more.
